**KokCTRC** (Kokturk CUDA To ROCm Compiler) is a project designed to transform CUDA code into ROCm (and vice versa) while also linting it. 

This is my passion project, so I am deeply invested in it. It's written in C++, and as the project is still in its very early stages, progress is slow but deliberate.

### Keep In Mind

This version includes only basic functionality, such as logging and basic table mappings. Advanced features like linting are not implemented yet, as the project is still in development. 

If you find this project interesting or useful, consider starring it or donating to support further developmentâ€”it would mean a lot!
